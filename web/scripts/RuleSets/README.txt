Not gonna do now, cuz I have other shit to do:

BUT.

STATED GOAL: MAKE THE WORLD'S MOST CONFUSING TRADING CARD GAME (AI BATTLES ONLY).

Have a game.html page, which is very similar to the index.html page, but the cards it generates are more constrained.

Instead of text layers, have stat layer and effects layer and symbol layer(maybe).

An effect has a list of effects in it. An effect is target/action pairs.

Burn your opponent's deck, burn your opponent's deck, too. Would have two effects, one on
myDeck and one on enemyDeck.

What the burn effect DOES depends on what rule set we are using.

In one ruleset it might replace the deck with a pile of ashes and set it's cards to zero.
In another it might discard all cards in the deck.

Come up with categories of actions/targets. Angst/Confusion might all just reduce stats.
Discard/Make Irrelevant might discard.

(what the stats are varies by ruleset, too).

Broad ruleset thoughts:

* decides what targets mean (is any card a creature or only consort/denizen?).
* decide what effects do
* decides how overarching gameplay works. do you get mana? is there an hp stat? can you attack with multiple cards per turn?

Have just one target and one effect at first, to test with. expand out.



Possible targets:
 * discard pile/graveyard/irrelevancy corner
 * deck/cards/stockpile
 * creature/monster
 * coin
 * ring
 * egg
 * card/deed/feat/artifact
 * enemy/oponent/other player/ god / head

 Possible effects:

 * tap/use/flip/order/pile
 * draw/create/retrieve/grab/steal/farm
 * play/use/scatter/place/levitate/throw/entrench
 * discard/vore/imbibe/devour/ throw away/defeat/slay/murder
 * destroy/shred/burn/crumple/shatter/smash
 * select/choose/be/wear/become/sample/smell/taste/handle
 * elevate/understand/contemplate/fondly regard/
 * weaken/dominate/humiliate/oggle/placate/sip/resist/enslave
